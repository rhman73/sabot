# sabot
This is a Webex Teams bot (beta) intended to help find needed files for UC designs. It will ask you questions and based on your responses it will generate a list of required design documents, and links to the current version of the documents.

# requirements
You will need to set your Webex Teams Bot Access Token to the WEBEX_TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable. Also included is a sample "history_list_starter.txt" file. This can be used for storing and tracking user's past responses. Change the name of this file to "history_list.txt" before starting the bot.
